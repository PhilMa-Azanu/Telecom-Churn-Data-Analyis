# Telecom-Churn-Data-Analyis
For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this case study, I analyzed a dataset from a telecom company called Vertex Mobile.
The manager had concluded that it is time to make fundamental changes in customer retention strategies and business operations due to a reduction in revenue over the few months.
For these reasons, I analyzed customer data to track customer attrition rate so that we can help adjust the company policies and thus keep the customers happy as they use the company’s telecom services.
Using Power BI as the main BI tool:
Analyzed customer data to track customer attrition.
Investigated churn reasons & understand why customers become churners
Dived deeper into churn categories and identify the most prevalent churn category, followed by the percentage of total churners.
Analyzed the different demographic fields from the dataset
Created a line and stacked column chart that shows the number of customers and churn rate for every age bracket.
Analyzed if customers that are part of a group indeed have a lower phone bill and if it has an impact on the churn rate.
Observed how yearly and monthly contracts affect the churn rate. Next, created a clustered column chart to see how customers differ in terms of churn rate by looking at their contract categories and gender.
Investigated how the Unlimited Data Plan influences the churn rate.
Created a matrix that shows the churn rate by the variables IntlPlan and IntlActive.
Investigate three important topics related to customers: they include payment method, contact type, and how many months a person is a customer. Evaluated if the churn rate decreases over time. Created a Line Chart using the account length and churn rate.
Checked the characteristics of the states regarding the customer service calls and the churn label. Next, created a Line chart to show the Churn Label and the Avg Customer Service Calls from your data model. Added markers to the line chart, and placed the visual to the bottom left corner of the page, under the cards. Investigated the relationships on visualization.
Created a map in Power BI to investigate the churn rate by state. 
Used a different gradient of colour so it’s easy to spot states with a higher churn rate. 
Generated other insights we can obtain from the data.
Finally, proposed solutions and recommendations.
